# PocketBook Highlights to Readwise CSV converter

If you own a PocketBook and would like to import your highlights to Readwise, the process is not straighforward since Readwise does not support the PocketBook Cloud yet.

PocketBook devices offer an export functionality which will write all highlights into HTML files to a folder within the device's internal storage. You can then connect it to your computer and activate data transfer mode to copy the HTMLs. This tool extracts your highlights from all PocketBook HTML files within a given folder and write a CSV file which you can then use with Readwise's CSV Import.
